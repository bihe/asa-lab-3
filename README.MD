# ASA Lab SonarQube

In this Lab we are working with [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/) and use it to analyze Software Projects. SonarQube is very widely used and provides software metrics derived from [static code analysis](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Static_Code_Analysis). Please note that there are other solutions available performing similar activities as well.

## 1.  Requirements

We are going to work with a locally installed version of SonarQube. There are a couple of options to startup a local instance. Either download a specific released version from the SonarQube homepage or use a docker-compose file to startup an instance.

### 1.1 Java

We need an installed java version for SonarQube and also for the software examples we are going to analyze. It is very much recommended to use a LTS OpenJDK version. Go to https://adoptium.net/en-GB/ to download the current java LTS version.

### 1.2 SonarQube standalone instance

We will use the 'Community Edition' because it can be used freely without the need for any payment. Download this version from the page https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/downloads/.

Unpack to downloaded archive to a working directory. Change into directory `./sonarqube-9.9.xx/bin` and use the folder for your specific OS (linux, mac, win). 
Within the OS-specific folder start SonarQube in `console mode`.

```bash
# linux/mac
./sonar.sh console

# output
/usr/bin/java
Running SonarQube...
Removed stale pid file: ./SonarQube.pid
...
2023.03.26 14:58:43 INFO  app[][o.s.a.SchedulerImpl] Process[ce] is up
2023.03.26 14:58:43 INFO  app[][o.s.a.SchedulerImpl] SonarQube is operational
```

### 1.3 SonarQube as a container

If your OS is capable of running containers, SonarQube does not need to be downloaded, starting the SonarQube container image is sufficient to run a local instance.

SonarQube has documentation of running a container version: https://github.com/SonarSource/docker-sonarqube/blob/master/examples.md

Firt create a local folder where SonarQube will store data, logs and its configuration. 

```bash
# linux/mac
mkdir -p ./sonardata/data && mkdir -p ./sonardata/extensions && mkdir -p ./sonardata/logs

# windows

```

The following commands will start the SonarQube container (the 'Community Edition').

```bash
# linux/mac
docker run \
    -v $(PWD)/sonardata/data:/opt/sonarqube/data \
    -v $(PWD)/sonardata/extensions:/opt/sonarqube/extensions \
    -v $(PWD)/sonardata/logs:/opt/sonarqube/logs \
    --name="sonarqube" -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:9.9-community
```

The same can be achieved by using a docker compose file like the following.

```yaml
# compose.yaml
version: "3"
services:
  sonarqube:
    image: sonarqube:9.9-community
    container_name: sonarqube
    volumes:
      - ./sonardata/data:/opt/sonarqube/data
      - ./sonardata/extensions:/opt/sonarqube/extensions
      - ./sonardata/logs:/opt/sonarqube/logs
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
```

To run the compose file execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f compose.yaml up

# output
